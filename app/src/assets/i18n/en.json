  "AGGREGATE_DEFINITION": "(FR) Un agrégat (sous-entendu naturel) est le résultat d’un arrangement naturel des constituants du sol (Baize, 2004). Les agrégats se séparent spontanément lors de l’extraction du bloc ou suite à une très faible pression. Selon la qualité structurale du sol les agrégats seront plus ou moins poreux (perméable aux racines, à l’eau et à l’air).",

Ces mottes sont très peu prospectées par les racines du fait de leur compacité. En observant des mottes fermées on remarquera que les racines préfèrent courir à leur surface (en présentant un faciès en arrêtes de poisson) plutôt que de s’aventurer à l’intérieur de ces mottes. Néanmoins des racines peuvent pénétrer dans des zones massives et fermées lorsque la phase d'implantation se fait en conditions humides. Ces mottes fermées sont difficiles à débiter en plus petits éléments sauf en cas de sol très humide.",
